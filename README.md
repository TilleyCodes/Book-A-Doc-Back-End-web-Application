## Dependent Software and Packages

The Book A Doc application depends on several key software packages, each chosen to fulfil specific requirements of a modern backend API system:  

### Core Dependencies:  

- **Express.js (v4.21.2):** serves as the foundation of our web server, providing a robust framework for building RESTful APIs with minimal configuration. Express was selected for its flexibility, performance, and extensive middleware ecosystem.  

- **MongoDB (v8.10.1):** MongoDB (v8.10.1): Our NoSQL database solution that stores all application data in document format, allowing for flexible schema evolution as the application requirements change.  

- **Mongoose (v8.10.1):** A MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a schema-based solution for model definition, validation, and business logic hooks.  

- **bcrypt (v5.1.1):** Handles password hashing for our authentication system, implementing industry standard security practices for storing patient/user credentials.  

- **jsonwebtoken (v9.0.2):** Manages token based authentication, enabling secure stateless communication between the client and server.  

- **cors (v2.8.5):** Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the API to be consumed by clients from different domains.  

- **helmet (v8.0.0):** Adds essential HTTP security headers to protect our application from common web vulnerabilities.  

- **dotenv (v16.4.7):** Manages environment variables, ensuring sensitive configuration details aren't hardcoded in the application.  

### Development Dependencies:

- **ESLint (v8.57.1) with Airbnb Base Config (v15.0.0):** Enforces code style standards across the project, ensuring consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code.  

- **Jest (v29.7.0):** Provides our testing framework, enabling comprehensive unit and integration testing.  

- **Supertest (v7.0.0):** Facilitates HTTP assertion testing, allowing us to verify our API endpoints behave as expected.  

- **MongoDB Memory Server (v10.1.4):** Creates an in-memory MongoDB instance for testing, ensuring tests run in isolation without affecting production data.  

## Hardware Requirements  

The Book A Doc application has been designed to run efficiently on modest hardware configurations.

### Development Environment:

- Any modern computer with at least 4GB RAM  
- 2GHz dual-core processor or better  
- 1GB free disk space for the application and dependencies  
- Internet connection for accessing MongoDB Atlas (if using cloud database)  

### Production Environment:

- Recommended minimum server specifications:  
    - 2 CPU cores  
    - 4GB RAM  
    - 10GB SSD storage  
    - Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer recommended)  

### Scalability Considerations:

As user demand grows, the application can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer, or vertically by increasing resources allocated to the server. The MongoDB database can also be scaled independently as data volume increases.
